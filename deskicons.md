# Disabling Desktop Icons
Like other things on KDE Plasma, desktop icons follow the paradigm of "It's not a setting, its a module."
Or in other words, if you want something on Plasma to behave entirely different, usually you're not looking for a setting, but a different module.

In the case of disabling desktop icons, it's very simple.
1. Right click your desktop, and click "Desktop and Wallpaper" (or type <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>).
2. Change the layout from "Folder View" to "Desktop".
3. Click Apply.

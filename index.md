# Moon's Linux Knowledge Base

The goal for this site is to offer a guide to getting started, configuring, and troubleshooting on Linux (specifically designed for [Fedora KDE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde/))

It amasses information from different sources, including, but not limited to: [the Fedora Docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/), [the ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page), [RPMFusion Howto](https://rpmfusion.org/Howto), various forums, and of course, my own knowledge. Show the websites mentioned here some love, people have spent lots of time making useful documentation, and you should take advantage of it. Especially the ArchWiki (while it doesn't directly apply to Fedora, it is still an invaluable resource).

Also join [the PC Help Hub](https://discord.gg/pchh) over on Discord. This resource is meant to be used alongside some resources found there, and the people over there, including myself, are very welcome to help you with any problems you may encounter.
